![Desktop View](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0031884415_20.jpg){: .right }{: .shadow }{: w="320" }Hi! I'm Martín. I'm a 3D artist living in Chile. I graduated as a Digital Animator, but my main focus has been hard surface 3D modeling for real-time rendering engines.
I'm always exploring different mediums and have worked in various areas, such as vector animation, video editing, creating assets for virtual and augmented reality, audio design, and more.

I'm passionate about creative media, both digital and traditional, and I've always had an interest in everything related to audio and music.

In my free time, I try to learn new things and experiment with creating music or other audio-related projects. My latest creative inspiration has been learning some modding techniques for Unreal Engine 5, and it's been a rewarding and fun experience.
