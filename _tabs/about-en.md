![Desktop View](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0031884415_20.jpg){: .right }{: .shadow }{: w="320" }Hi! I'm Martín. I'm a 3D artist living in Chile. I graduated as a Digital Animator, but my main focus has been hard surface 3D modeling for real-time rendering engines.

I've worked in different projects related to audiovisual mediums and I'm always exploring different ways to explore spaces where the technoloy and the creative ideas blend together, either independent or as part of a team with members from different backgrounds. Some of the areas I've been interested in include vector animations, video editing, creating assets for virtual and augmented reality, audio design, and more.

I'm  really passionate about creative media, both digital and traditional, and I've always had an interest in everything related to audio and music. I've been collecting different sources of inspiration through the years that at some point they met each other and what starts as just a simple idea, ends up being an awesome project to work on.
In my free time, I try to learn new things and experiment creating music, exploring audio-related stuff or any other fun thing available. My latest creative inspiration has been learning some modding techniques for Unreal Engine 5, and it's been a rewarding and fun experience.
