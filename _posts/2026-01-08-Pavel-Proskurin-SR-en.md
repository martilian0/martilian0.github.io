_Side view Concept_


This was a 3D modeling project inspired by a side view concept made by **[Pavel Proskurin](https://www.artstation.com/pavellkid)** .
It was a really fun project to work on and learn a bit more about wood materials.

![Desktop View](/assets/pavelproskurin/references.jpg){: .right }{: .shadow }{: w="320" }I began by gathering ton of references, because even though it was an image concept, it was based from real historical weapons. As I was looking for more info about what kind of gun this could be, I noticed that it was a mix between a soviet silenced rifle, and an old bolt rifle made in the United Kingdom, The first was the **[VSS Vintorez](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Vintorez)**, A soviet rifle manifactured around the end of the 1980 decade, and the second was the **[Lee Enfield No.4 Mk1](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Enfield)** or also known as the SMLE(Short Magazine Lee-Enfield).

In the concept provided by Pavel Proskurin, is very noticeable that the main frame of the weapon correspond to the bolt rifle, but the big silenced barrel was the one that is integrated in the VSS Vintorez and AS VAl weapon models which have a knurling pattern in the middle to have a better grip.

The scope also is a mix of different sights, the more noticeable is the mount and the front lens of a classic russian **[PSO - 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSO-1)** attatched with a side rail, but the bigger lense and body at the end correspond to a type of LPVO or long range sniper rifle scope.

I also worked in some animations for the model that i did not end up using in the end. but Still was a good experimentation to check how well the model could actually work in a real game environment.
The reason i did not include them at the end was because the animation needed to be polished and also had to finish some other projects at the same time. So i stuck to the main asset modeling and texturing instead.

Another thing I like to mention is that I've learned a couple of things about these weapons that have some interesting cultural and historical value.
For example when I was texturing the model, I've realized that the weapon have some marks in the metal pieces, and after googling here and there I found that these marks were actually a method of identification and categorization, from where and by who it was manifcatured, to modifications in the cannon for high velocity rounds, marks that indicated if it was property of the crown or it has military ownership, and even marks for use after war, in case this weapons traveled, they could recognize and track if it was a weapon acquired legally, or not.
