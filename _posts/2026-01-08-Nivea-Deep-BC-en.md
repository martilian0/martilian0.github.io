This was a spontaneous project inspired by one of the Nivea products I had around. I don't know why It came to me the idea of trying to see if I can make a 3D render like one of those tv  ads that generally display a close up shot of their products.

So I began to collect references of the bottle design to model it as close as it looked in real life.



I found a one a good enough resolution image of the product and that came really helpful to texture later on.

But yeah, It was a fun little project, not very fancy but good enough to do for fun and experiment 😃.
