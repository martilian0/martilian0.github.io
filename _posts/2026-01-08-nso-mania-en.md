This project consisted in creating an audiovisual transition for a channel that was truly inspired by Nintendo retro games.
It was mainly designed to be outputed it as a WEBM file so it could be added in OBS for streaming purposes, likewise as youtube videos.

The idea was to create a composition containing multiple elements related to the topic of retro gaming. Such elements included classic videogames cartridges and hardware from old Nintendo era that passed floating around the main logo to end up higlighting it.
