Hello! I've created this post to share some footage from a couple of modding experiments I've been doing in the past month.

I've been experimenting with the current tools of the Ready or Not modding community, and I've been able to succesfully include some content in the game. I included a Mexican Sombrero in the game just for fun just to see if the model was able to display properly in game with textures and everything.

I also added new voicelines for the game player and npcs.

 In the following videos you can hear a mexican voiceline shouting Viva Mexico! and similar phrases, and in the next one, a Chilean guy being mad for being arrested and speaking with a distinct accent used by gang members in here.

There is a Chilean Spanish slang term used to describe aggressive people that dont follow social norms, they are usually gang members and we call them [flaites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaite). You can see them very often wearing shirts from their favorite soccer sports club, kinda like hooligans but from Chile. Is a general term though, this doesn't mean that everyone wearing these shirts are flaites, but I thought it could be something cultural that we (as chileans) can recognize easily and could fit really well as the bad guys for this game.
