This is some footage from a couple of modding experiments I've been doing in the past month.

I included a Mexican Sombrero just for fun, and see if the model was able to display properly in game, with textures and everything.

And also I added new voicelines for the game and npcs.

Here the people that dont follow social norms usually are called flaites. They wear shirts from their favorite soccer sports club, kinda like hooligans but from Chile. So I thought they will fit really well as gang members LOL.
